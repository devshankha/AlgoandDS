Basic coding things to remember-----
To remember:



Remember this logic--

// Both roots are NULL, trees isomorphic by definition 
 if (n1 == null && n2 == null) 
    return true; 
   
 // Exactly one of the n1 and n2 is NULL, trees not isomorphic 
 if (n1 == null || n2 == null) 
     return false; 
     
//how to find rows and columns of a 2d matrix


matrix.length; // total rows of a matrix
matrix[0].length; //Total columns of Original Matrix

--------------------
remember this method==getOrDefault in a HashMap

Map<String,String> m = new HashMap<String,String>();
		m.put("a", "a");
		m.put("b", "b");
		m.put("c", "c");
		System.out.println(m.getOrDefault("a", "david"));
		
		-----------------------------
		
Arrays.sort() always sorts in place
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Not direct to convert int[] to List<Integer> using Arrays.asList, as  Arrays.asList does not deal with boxing and will just create a List<int[]> which is not what you want. 
You have to make a utility method.

int[] ints = {1, 2, 3};
List<Integer> intList = new ArrayList<Integer>(ints.length);
for (int i : ints)
{
    intList.add(i);
}
