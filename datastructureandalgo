Important thing to learn ==== Timer wheel datastructure


Linked list:

1.Reverse a linkedlist
2.Convert a linkedlist in zig zag fashion
3.intersection point of two linked lists
4. reverse a doubly linked list
5. Delete a Node from linked list without head pointer


Matrix:
Rotate a matrix


Tree:
1. Print left view of a binary tree
2. BFS and DFS
3. Check if a binary tree is a BST
4.print elements of a binary tree in level order
5. Iterative preorder traversal
6. Iterative inorder traversal
7. traverse a tree in spiral form
8. convert bst to dll.
9. Find if 2 binary trees are isomorphic

Heap:
1.Huffman algorithm and tree
2. sort n number of sorted 
s  Sort a nearly sorted (or K sorted) array
3.

Dynamic programming:
1. longest common subsequence
2. find numbers in an array that add to a sum
3. Find nth Catalan number
4. Find nth ugly number
5. Find number of BST with n distinct keys
6.Count ways to reach the nth stair using step 1, 2 or 3
7Coin change problem

Backtracking:
1. Colouring a graph

Greedy algoritms:
activity sequencing problem
work scheduling program

Arrays:

find pairs in an array that add to a sum
the petrol problem
Remove duplicates from an unsorted array
count distinct elements in an array
find missing number in contiguous array (using xor)
For a given array of repeated elements, exactly one element is not repeated. You need to return the non-repeated element.
[1, 2, 5, 4, 6, 8, 9, 2, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9]
sort an array of 0s and ,1s
sort an array of 0s,1s and 2s
Rearrange positive and negative numbers with constant extra space
Sort an almost sorted array which requires only one swap

Design a hit counter:

Puzzles:
25 horses, 5 tracks problem

String problems:
Find if characters in a string can form a palindrome
Fing element in a sparse string
Find the first non repeating character in the string
Find all permutations of a string
Check whether 2 strings are anagrams of each other
Find if all unique characters are there in string without additional structure , excellent use of bitwise operators


//Things to do as of now
revise ---design a parking lot, a chess game, amazon online system
string anagrams, revise Python//algorithm complexity, graph colouring problem
permutations using backtracking, design a rate delimiter, stak and queue problems, 
if binary tree is balanced
elastic search, kibana, Grafana,trie datastructure, duplicates in URL
// sort +ve and -ve numbers in an array

Misc:

shuffle an array, shuffle a pack of cards


To remember:

Remember this logic--

// Both roots are NULL, trees isomorphic by definition 
 if (n1 == null && n2 == null) 
    return true; 
   
 // Exactly one of the n1 and n2 is NULL, trees not isomorphic 
 if (n1 == null || n2 == null) 
     return false; 
     
//how to find rows and columns of a 2d matrix


matrix.length; // total rows of a matrix
matrix[0].length; //Total columns of Original Matrix
